#MiniVis
##Tool to previsualize 3D-printable Models. Potential application areas are:
- Coloring  3D-Models in order to preview and find suitable color combinations before painting the physical model.
- Identifying shaded areas by adjusting light position, color and intensity.
- Getting a reference for Object Source Lighting or other lighting effects.

##This tool is implemented in Qt 6.9 using Qt Quick (QML) and C++ 20.
Additionally to build the project Vulkan 1.4 is required. You can find the latest Vulkan SDK [here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).
